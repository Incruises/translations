"Much will depend on your personal idea of success and your effort and "

"will mean success. inCruises has a proven, fair, and effective program that "
"is being used by many thousands of different Partners to achieve varying "
"levels of success. That said, inCruises does not guarantee any level of "
"success for its Partners and is NOT an opportunity where one should expect "
"to make thousands of dollars in income overnight. Those who hope to simply "
"Activate as a Partner and suddenly earn income will likely be disappointed "
"with inCruises and should not join as a Partner. Again, the consistency and "
"type of effort and individual ability will determine success with inCruises."
