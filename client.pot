"<br/><br/>I used to think that only wealthy people could go on ocean "
"cruises and that cruise vacations were extremely expensive. Actually, I "
"never even considered trying to go on a cruise. <br/><br/>However, in "
"September 2019, a friend of mine introduced me to inCruises. When I saw the "
"travel prices available to members, I thought the publicly available prices "
"were amazingly cheap. Right away, I had the desire to go on a cruise. I "
"instantly thought about taking my family on this wonderful cruise. Without "
"any hesitation, I became a member. <br/><br/> Unfortunately, due to "
"COVID-19, I couldn’t go on a cruise at that time. But during that period, I "
"kept making my membership payments. Now, I’m preparing for an incredible "
"cruise with the person I love the most.<br/><br/> Beyond that, I really "
"like inCruises' vision and values. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity "
"it provides to millions of people worldwide—making cruises more accessible "
"and affordable while also offering a way to earn income while traveling. "
"Most importantly, I am extremely happy that inCruises has given me the "
"chance to explore all the places I have ever dreamed of visiting and also "
"the potential to achieve financial freedom.<br/><br/> Honestly, the "
"inCruises system is an outstanding program. I am truly grateful to the "
"founders, Michael Hutchison and Frank Codina, for their dedication to "
"members’ success and for creating a platform that can completely transform "

"important to the industry’s growth. In 2019, the cruise industry carried "
"29,000,000 passengers worldwide (up 11.2 million from 2009). By 2025, this "
